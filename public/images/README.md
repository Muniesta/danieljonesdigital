# Portfolio Images Directory

This directory contains all the portfolio images used in the website.

## Adding New Images

1. Add your image files to the appropriate subdirectory
2. Update the portfolio.json file with the correct image paths
3. Ensure images are optimized for web (WebP format recommended)
4. Use descriptive filenames that match your portfolio items

## Image Guidelines

-   Recommended format: WebP, JPEG, AVIF etc
-   Max width: 1920px for hero images, 800px for portfolio items
-   Optimize for web to reduce file size
-   Use consistent aspect ratios for portfolio items

## Placeholder Images

If images are missing, the website will show placeholder images automatically. Replace these with your actual portfolio images.
